# Ikeda_Roux_Salort_Smets
This code contains the parameters and functions used to produce the figures of the article "Theoretical study of the emergence of periodic solutions for the inhibitory NNLIF neuron model with synaptic delay" by Kota Ikeda, Pierre Roux, Delphine Salort and Didier Smets.

Running the code will produce all the figures at once, but it is possible to comment some lines in the part "## Production of the figures" in order to produce only some of the figures.

The numerical scheme used in this code for computing a approximations of the solutions of the NNLIF model was proposed by Jingwei Hu, Jian-Guo Liu, Yantong Xie and Zhennan Zhou in the article "A structure preserving numerical scheme for Fokker-Planck equations of neuron networks: numerical analysis and exploration".
